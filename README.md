# NimbusCast - Weather with a Side of Poetry

NimbusCast is a full-stack app that tracks and forecast global weather data in real time, and delivers a poem at random based on the conditions in the area you search.

Note that background images will change based on the weather in the city you are searching.

# ðŸš€ Getting started

## Project Installation - What you need

Use the guidelines below to work on this project on your local machine: 

First, make sure you have **Node.js** and **npm** installed on your local machine. Follow the steps written [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

After, you finished installing:

- Fork this project and clone it in your machine. Feel free to use any text editor of your preference. 
- Once you have it cloned in your machine, run the following command in the console for both folders: `Client` and `Server`.

```js
  // go to each folder
  cd client
  cd server

  // install dependencies
  npm install || npm i
```

To launch the entire application, use two separate console views and run the following commands, starting with the `Server` and moving on to the `Client`:

```js
  // for the server
  npm start

  // for the client
  npm start
```
Don't worry if your `Client` console prompt asks you to run the application in a different port after you've completed the previous commands. Since you are running your `Server` first, this is entirely typical.


## API Connection - How to connect
**IMPORTANT**: As you work through the code, you will notice that you need a `SECRET_KEY_API` in order to access all of the data from the OpenWeatherMap API. For that reason, I will suggest that you get one on your own first, and modify the code to fit it by creating a separate `.env` file in the Back-End and saving it there.

Once you have created it, please be careful and DO NOT publish your `.env` file anywhere.

The instructions to get your own `SECRET_KEY_API` are available [here](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up).

Luckily, this does not applicable to PoetryDB API.

# ðŸš€ Tech Stack - Tools used

The tech stack utilised to create this app was as follows:
- **For the Back-End:** *Node.js* together with *Express*
- **For the Front-End:** *React.js* together with *TailwindCSS*

Additionally, this application uses two distinct APIs to obtain its data,  [WeatherOpenMap](https://openweathermap.org/) to find out the current weather conditions, and [PoetryDB](https://poetrydb.org/index.html) to get a selection of random poems.

# ðŸš€ Further Optimization

You are welcome to add new features to what has already been developed, as well as make any changes you deem necessary. I also left a couple of cases and recommendations in this [repo's issues section](https://github.com/PilySwatch/weather-app/issues), so feel free to look at them if you're itching to do so.
